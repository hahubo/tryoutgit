Release 8

be generated. You can add items of interest to external users
in plain ASCII. They will be edited by the time of the release.

- Trimming added

- Keyword FAILURE extended with options to automatically
  check neighbouring elements.

- Correction for planar anisotropic Vegter model with Vegter hardening.
  This combination failed in 7.1 (also prepared for 7.2).

- Correction of rotated basis when elements with different numbers
  of dofs are in the model (nvrpel<mvrpel). Also included possible
  use of rotated basis with thermo-mechanical shell elements.
  (also prepared for 7.2).

- Implemented fracture criteria (*FRCR) for plate elements.
  Before it was only implemented for solid elements.

- Keywords *THICK and *THSW have been merged into *THICK
  A constant thickness can be set per elementgroup.

- Changes for the keyword *CONTACT:
  + Added output in GiD format
  + CONTOUR2D => Now possible to give a range of nodes instead specifying them all separately
  + NEUTRAL => Neutral files can also be used for 2D contours
  + Resultant force of a contact pair can be saved in a file "contact.tab" using *OUTPUT/FOLLOW

- Logfile "vorm.dat" has been renamed to "inputfile.log" 
  
-Changed output in PATRAN format to standard. Now:
 + Only a basename.neu is written (old 0.neu) and not stepnr.neu for ALE anymore.
 + stepnr.nod is now called basename_stepnr.nod
 + stepnr.dis is now called basename_stepnr.dis
 + For every *REFINE/*TRIM the basename is changed automatically to basename_r<stepnr>
   and no stepnumber will be skipped anymore
 +*CONTACT: slave1.neu is renamed to basename_slave1.neu, etc
 + *REFINE/*WRINKLING: Output is not generated automatically anymore.
   It has to be switched on under *OUTPUT with resp ERROR or WRINKLING.
 + *OUTPUT/CONTACT has been renamed to *OUTPUT/NIC (Nodes In Contact)
   in case of contact elements to avoid confusion with *CONTACT, 
   which still used *OUTPUT/CONTACT.

-Input from PATRAN neutral files
 + Added option for import of constrains and connects.
 + A neutral file may contain more than one elementgroup or loadset.

-Restart files:
 + Names conform other output files.
 + Restart file from step 10 of basename.inv
   basename.inv10.bin => basename_10.bin (or asc instead bin)
 + Refine or trim after step 10
   basename_r11.inv.bin => basename_r11_10.bin
   Also: basename_r11.inv.ref => basename_r11.ref
 + Inputfile: full filename has to be given at *RESTART

- Input for Bergstrom-VanLiempt hardening adapted to manual
  m is a positive number (-m previously).

be generated. You can add items of interest to external users
in plain ASCII. They will be edited by Ton, by the time of
the release (October 2000).

Add the name of the main developer to the text, so I can ask
for more information if necessary.

1. Added pressure loads on continuum and shell elements.  (Ton)

2. Toolcheck is not longer nessecary (Timo)

3. Toolnodes can be used for contour-steering (Timo)

4. Creating neutral files during iteration is not longer available (Timo)

5. Connects for the outer contact nodes are created by Dieka (Timo)

6. Projection of conact nodes on the tools is also done at begin of first
   step or at begin of first step after a restart (Timo)

7. Deepdrawing preprocessor is up-to-date (Timo)

8. Some fracture criteria are calculated using *FRCR (Harm)

9. Some changes in the use of surface options (Harm)
   a) READPRIOR added; Options are treated in same order as read from inputfile
   b) Number of neighbor and Auxiliary points is made variable between 0 and 15
      (was fixed to 5).
   c) The priority of curves is now linked to the priority of normal nodes.

10. Refine option is available (for sheet metal forming)

11. Hill '48 material model, including isotropic, kinematic and mixed
    hardening for continuum elements. (Ton)
